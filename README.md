 1) the use of JavaScript
  i can build websites(vanila js , node) and mobile applications(react Nactive) using Javascript 
  
2)  the client-side of a website refers to the web browser and the server-side is where the data and source code is stored
  
3) Node. js is not a programming language. Rather, it's a back-end runtime environment that's used to run  on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside the browser.
4) JavaScript has 3 types of scope: Block scope. Function scope. Global scope. 
a) Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block
b) Local variables have Function Scope, They can only be accessed from within the function.
c) Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
5) JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language. That just means that only one operation can be in progress at a time.
6) JavaScript is a single-threaded language because while running code on a single thread, it can be really easy to implement as we don't have to deal with the complicated scenarios that arise in the multi-threaded environment like deadlock. Since, JavaScript is a single-threaded language, it is synchronous in nature.
7) Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.
